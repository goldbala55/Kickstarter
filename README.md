# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise, an aspiring producer, has used Kickstarter to fund a previous production – Fever.  In anticipation of producing additional shows Louise has requested an analysis on how successful other campaigns were considering their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
To provide the analysis Louise is seeking we utilized historical fundraising data from the Kickstarter site.  The raw data contains many categories of projects over many years.  

We have focused on two analysis:
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    For this analysis we considered the outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) for all ‘Theater’ projects totaled across months.  All years were considered, but a filter is provided to drill into individual years.  The results are found here: https://github.com/goldbala55/Kickstarter/tree/main/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png/
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    This analysis focused on outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) and fine tuned the filtering to just include ‘plays’.  The data was categorized into fundraising goal ranges and totals and percentages by outcome were calculated for all plays.  The results are found here:https://github.com/goldbala55/Kickstarter/tree/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png/

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    The complete data and the detailed analysis is located here https://github.com/goldbala55/Kickstarter/Kickstarter-Challenge.xslx/
    No major challenges or difficulties were encountered. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  
     Theater productions through Kickstarter have a strong success rate with the May-June timeframe the best time to launch campaigns.
     Theater productions are rarely canceled.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  
     Low-cost campaigns, $5000 or less, have a highest success rate:73-76%. The large volume of campaigns in this range provides a strong indicator of a successful campaign.
     Campaigns in the $35,000-$45,000 range have a high rate of success rate of 67%.  But with only 9 total campaigns further analysis is required to see if this is significant.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  
     We cannot easily cross-reference this data to confirm its completeness or accuracy.
     There are no canceled plays; this seems questionable.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  
    I would recommend adding a table of core statistics and Box and Whisker to assess how clustered the data is.  I would also investigate duration of the campaigns – how long to be successful at the goal ranges analyzed?
